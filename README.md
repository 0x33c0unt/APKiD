# APKiD

This tool gives you information about how an APK was made. It can detect compilers, packers, and obfuscators.

_It's [PEiD](https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/PEiD) for Android._


# Installing

```bash
pip install apkid
```

# Hacking

To install the package from source in editable mode (useful for devlopment):

```bash
pip install --process-dependency-links -e .
```

The `--process-dependency-links` is necessary to install our custom fork of [`yara-python`](https://github.com/rednaga/yara-python).
